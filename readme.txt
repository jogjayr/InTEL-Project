
To get the JavaMonkeyEngine project, download
http://lcc.gatech.edu/~cashmore/Statics/JavaMonkeyEngine.zip

You can unzip this file somewhere and add it as a project path to the Statics project. Please do not add it to the SVN repository, as that will lead to much confusion, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.
