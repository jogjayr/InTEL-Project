fbd_tooltip_force=This tool creates a force that you can place on the diagram

fbd_tooltip_moment=This tool creates a moment (couple) that you can place on the diagram

fbd_tools_createMoment=Create Moment\: move the moment to a point on the diagram and click the mouse.

fbd_tools_createForce1=Create Force\: move the force to a point on the diagram and click the mouse.

fbd_tools_createForce2=Create Force\: now position the direction of the force and click the mouse.

equation_welcome=Click on a load to add it to the equation.

equation_feedback_momentPointSelect=Select the point about which to calculate the moment.


#Missing moment/force
equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_moments=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces about the observation point.

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_forces=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces working on the %s axis

#Unnecessary moment/force
equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessary=Note\: The force %s does not belong in the equation.

equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessaryMoment=Note\: The moment %s does not belong in the force equation.

#Wrong sign on coefficient
equation_feedback_check_fail_wrong_sign=Note\: The coefficient for %s is correct, but has the wrong sign

#Parse error coefficient
equation_feedback_check_fail_parse=Note\: Your coefficient "%s" for %s is poorly formed

#No moment point selected
equation_feedback_check_fail_moment_point_not_set=Note\: You need to set a point about which to calculate the moments

#Good distance, no perpindicular
equation_feedback_check_fall_perpindicular=Note\: Your distance for %s is correct but you are lacking the term to get your component perpindicular to the moment arm

#Missing couple
equation_feedback_check_fail_couples=Note\: Your equation must contain couples visible in the system

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_inclination=Note\: Your coefficient for %s is missing the inclination for the force

# symbol related feedback
