fbd_feedback_welcome=Add forces and moments to the diagram.


fbd_feedback_check_fail_add=Node\: You have not added any loads to your diagram

fbd_feedback_check_fail_reverse=Node\: Your %s %s at %s is pointing the wrong direction 


fbd_feedback_check_fail_given=Note\: You are missing a given acting on the diagram at %s

fbd_feedback_check_fail_given_symbol=Note\: The given %s at point %s should be symbolic

fbd_feedback_check_fail_given_number=Note\: The given %s at point %s should be numberic

fbd_feedback_check_fail_given_value=Note\: The given %s at point %s has the wrong magnitude


fbd_feedback_check_fail_weight=Note\: The body %s requires a weight applied to its center of mass

fbd_feedback_check_fail_weight_symbol=Note\: The weight for body %s should be symbolic

fbd_feedback_check_fail_weight_number=Note\: The weight for body %s should be numeric

fbd_feedback_check_fail_weight_value=Note\: The weight for body %s has the wrong magnitude



fbd_feedback_check_fail_joint_reaction=Note\: The %s at %s is missing its reaction loads

fbd_feedback_check_fail_joint_wrong_type=Note\: You are treating %s as a %s, whereas it is really a %s

fbd_feedback_check_fail_joint_wrong=Note\: You have added the wrong reactions at the %s at %s

fbd_feedback_check_fail_joint_cable=Note\: Your force at %s indicates that %s is in compression


fbd_feedback_check_fail_additional=Note\: Your diagram has an additional force and/or moment at point %s

fbd_feedback_check_fail_symbol=Note\: The force at point %s should be a number, not a symbol

fbd_feedback_check_fail_duplicate=Note\: Your %s at %s and %s at %s have the same name

#seemingly not used
fbd_feedback_check_fail_wrongWeight=Note\: The weight of one of your bodies is not the correct value

fbd_feedback_check_fail_unknown=Unknown Error\!

fbd_feedback_check_fail_numeric=Note\: The force at point %s should be a symbol, not a number

fbd_feedback_check_success=Your FBD is correct\!

fbd_tooltip_force=This tool creates a force that you can place on the diagram

fbd_tooltip_moment=This tool creates a moment (couple) that you can place on the diagram

fbd_tools_createMoment=Create Moment\: move the moment to a point on the diagram and click the mouse.

fbd_tools_createForce1=Create Force\: move the force to a point on the diagram and click the mouse.

fbd_tools_createForce2=Create Force\: now position the direction of the force and click the mouse.

equation_welcome=Click on a load to add it to the equation.

equation_feedback_momentPointSelect=Select the point about which to calculate the moment.

equation_warning_unsolvable=WARNING\: Your system of equations is not solvable, there are probably too many unknowns

equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessary=Note\: You have added a force that doesn't belong in the equation.

equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessaryMoment=Note\: Moments do not belong in a force equation.

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_moments=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces about the observation point.

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_forces=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces in the direction of observation

equation_feedback_check_fail_couples=Note\: Your equation must contain couples visible in the system

equation_feedback_check_fail_unknown=Note\: Unknown term error.

equation_feedback_check_fail_momentCoefficient=Note\: You should not have a coefficient on a moment.

equation_feedback_check_fail_parse=Note\: I can't understand your coefficient %s

equation_feedback_check_fail_coefficient=Note\: Your coefficient is not correct for %s

equation_feedback_check_fail_moment_point_not_set=Note\: You need to set a point about which to calculate the moments

equation_feedback_check_success=Note\: Congratulations\! Your equation is correct\! Now you can finish the other equations and solve for the unknowns.

equation_system_solved=You have solved for all the unknowns in this diagram! Please submit your work if you are done, or select a new diagram.
