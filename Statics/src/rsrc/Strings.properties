fbd_feedback_check_fail_weight=Note\: Your diagram must include weights for bodies with mass

fbd_feedback_check_fail_reaction=Note\: Your diagram is missing a reaction force

fbd_feedback_check_fail_additional=Note\: Your diagram has more forces and/or moments than necessary

fbd_feedback_check_fail_symbol=Note\: One of your forces should not be a symbol

fbd_feedback_check_fail_duplicate=Note\: You cannot have duplicate names in the FBD; please use the Label tool and give each unknown a unique name

fbd_feedback_check_fail_wrongWeight=Note\: The weight of one of your bodies is not the correct value

fbd_feedback_check_fail_unknown=Unknown Error\!

fbd_feedback_check_fail_numeric=Note\: One of your forces should not be numeric

fbd_tools_createForce1=Create Force\: move the force to a point on the diagram and click the mouse.

fbd_tools_createForce2=Create Force\: now position the direction of the force and click the mouse.

equation_welcome=Click on a load to add it to the equation.

equation_feedback_momentPointSelect=Select the point about which to calculate the moment.

equation_warning_unsolvable=WARNING\: Your system of equations is not solvable, there are probably too many unknowns

equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessary=Note\: You have added a force that doesn't belong in the equation.

equation_feedback_check_fail_unnecessaryMoment=Note\: Moments do not belong in a force equation.

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_moments=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces about the observation point.

equation_feedback_check_fail_missing_forces=Note\: Your equation must contain all forces in the direction of observation

equation_feedback_check_fail_couples=Note\: Your equation must contain couples visible in the system

equation_feedback_check_fail_unknown=Note\: Unknown term error.

equation_feedback_check_fail_momentCoefficient=Note\: You should not have a coefficient on a moment.

equation_feedback_check_fail_parse=Note\: I can't understand your coefficient %s

equation_feedback_check_fail_coefficient=Note\: Your coefficient is not correct for %s

equation_feedback_check_fail_moment_point_not_set=Note\: You need to set a point about which to calculate the moments

equation_feedback_check_success=Note\: Congratulations\! Your equation is correct\! Now you can finish the other equations and solve for the unknowns.

equation_system_solved=You have solved for all the unknowns in this diagram! Please submit your work if you are done, or select a new diagram.
